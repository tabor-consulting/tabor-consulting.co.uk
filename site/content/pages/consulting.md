### Educational Consulting - Ghana

Physics and General Sciences Reviewer for the Senior High School curriculum overhaul in Ghana.

During this engagement I performed the review and quality assurance process for:

- Teacher Manuals; documents designed to aide teachers in Ghana in implementing appropriate pedagogy, inclusive lesson plans and in incorporating 21st century skills.
- Learning Materials; documents designed for the learner; firstly to summarise the specification content clearly and secondly to provide a series of activities to perform and problems to solve to deepen and broaden their understanding.
- Subject specification, assessment structure and sample assessment materials.
