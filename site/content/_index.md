I'm a dedicated tutor and educational consultant based in Thornbury (Bristol, UK). I'm backed by over a decade of experience in some of the leading independent schools in the UK. I strive to inspire students and to equip them with the tools that they need to achieve their potential academically.

I am available for tutoring services online or in-person, specialising in the following subjects:

- A-level Physics
- GCSE Maths
- GCSE Science

My pricing ranges from £40-£60 per hour depending on level  (GCSE/A-level) and time of day.
